pyquadtree
==========

My attempt at relearning some C++ and working out how to make native python modules.
Inspired by Facebook's small world puzzle at:
    http://www.facebook.com/careers/puzzles.php


Implements a simple quadtree object that can efficiently return the n items nearest to a given point.
